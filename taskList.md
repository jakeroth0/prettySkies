## üöÄ Recommended Next Step

1. **Implement Dynamic Gradient**  
   - Define three color stops per score band  
   - Plug into `LinearGradient` on home & card views  
   - Verify visually against sample palettes  

After that, we can tackle "Remember Last-Viewed" logic, then move on to UI polish and finally App Store & IAP preparation.
